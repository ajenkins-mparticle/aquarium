### Editor configuration

- **Prettier**: For configuring your editor to play nicely with Prettier, take a look at the [Editors doc page](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors).
  - Also, if you're using VSCode you might want to set prettier as the default formatter and also turn on "Format on Save" option.
- **ESLint**: Check [Integrations doc page](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/integrations)
